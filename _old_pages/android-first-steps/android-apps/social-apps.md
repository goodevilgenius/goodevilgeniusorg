Unless you just emerged from a rock, you've heard of Facebook. Once
you've installed the Facebook app, I'd recommend making one change
to the settings.

Go into your app settings, and turn off "Video Auto-play." At the very least, I'd recommend changing it to "Wi-fi only" so that if you're using cellular data, you don't get hit with huge data charges because Facebook started playing videos you had no intention of watching. Personally, I turn it off completely, because I find the auto-play annoying.

I've tried many different Twitter apps. The official one used to be pretty terrible, so if you wanted a good Twitter experience, you had to use a third-party app. Nowadays, though, the official app is, in my opinion, the best. It allows for multiple accounts, uploading images, attaching images, and a bunch of other features.

Instagram is a photo-sharing service. With it, you can share square photos using
a bunch of different filters.

If you're going to use Instagram, this a good app to have. Since Instagram photos have to be square, you can use this app to add banners to the side of your pics so that you don't have to crop out crucial information. Open your images in this app first, add banners (either solid colors, or a blurry version of your picture), and then send to the Instagram app. If you want to be able to crop and add borders (I recommend it), there's a setting you need to change. Go into the settings, and check "Crop photo."

Vine is Instagram for video. I haven't used it myself, so I can't really say much about it.
