Android is great for watching TV and movies. Here is my video apps selection.

You'll need a Netflix subscription, which will let you stream all the Arrested Development, Firefly, and House of Cards that you want (and tons of movies and other shows)

Hulu beats Netflix for most currently running shows. Missed that episode of [The Simpson](http://www.hulu.com/the-simpsons "The Simpsons on Hulu") last night? You can watch it on Hulu. Hulu also has a really great selection of children's programming.

Crackle is a free video streaming service, mainly for fans of Jerry Seinfeld.

Crackle actually has a lot more than [Seinfeld](http://www.crackle.com/c/seinfeld "Seinfeld"), and [Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee](http://www.crackle.com/c/comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"). It has a decent selection of not-so-popular movies, and some good cartoons. And, unlike the other major ones, it's free.

Crunchyroll is an excellent video service specializing in anime, and Asian dramas. I'm pretty sure all of the content is in the original language with English subtitles. It has both free and paid accounts. If you pay, you can get next day episodes.

Viki is international (i.e., non-US) TV and movies, with an emphasis on Korean TV. Like Crunchyroll, it's all in the original language with English subtitles. Viki is also free, but you can pay to remove ads, and get HD video.

You probably already have this installed. Google's Play Store lets you rent and buy TV shows and movies. They have an extremely large selection, but won't be as up-to-date with TV as Hulu is.

You surely have this installed already as well. If you don't know what YouTube is, it's time to crawl out from under that rock you've been living under for the past decade.

**[XBMC/Kodi](http://kodi.tv/download/ "Kodi")**

This is one of the few I'll recommend not available in the Play Store. And I probably wouldn't recommend it for most people. XBMC is a great media player, that works wonderfully for a home theater PC. I use it on a small computer attached to my TV, but I also use it on my tablet, while at home, to stream videos that I have downloaded on my main computer on my tablet. For example, if I want to lay in bed and watch a show I've previously download, I'll use XBMC. XBMC is a very versatile program, and all the different things you can do with it are beyond the scope of this guide. Basically, if you're not already using XBMC on another computer, you probably won't have much use for it on your Android device. But if you have an Android TV device, XBMC would be a great addition to it.

There is a remix of XBMC called [TVMC](http://www.tvaddons.ag/tvmc-android/ "TVMC") that may be easier to set up and use.

Speaking of XBMC, if you want to use your Android device to control your HTPC, I recommend Yatse. This is an all-around great XBMC remote app.
