Here's another set of [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/) results for me:

> Your data suggest a moderate automatic preference for Accuracy compared to Speed.
>
> Depending on the magnitude of your result, your automatic associations may be described as 'slight', 'moderate', 'strong', or 'little to no preference (or identity)'.

That seems to be pretty spot on for me. I prefer to do things right, than do them fast. And here's another set of results:

> Your data suggest a strong association of Male with Science and Female with Liberal Arts compared to Female with Science and Male with Liberal Arts.
>
> If your performance is described as '(slight, moderate. or strong) association of Science with Male and Liberal Arts with Female' compared to the alternative pairings, it means you responded faster when Science and Male words were classified with the same key than when Liberal Arts and Male items shared a key. If your association was stronger for 'Liberal Arts with Male, Science with Female' you were faster when using the same key for Liberal Arts and Male items.

I think these results must be the result of culture, rather than actual personal feelings on my part. Also, their definition of Liberal Arts didn't quite jive with mine. They included Music, which I consider to be a Fine Art, rather than a Liberal Art.
