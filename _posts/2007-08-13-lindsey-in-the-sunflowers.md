I've been helping out my friend Geoff Yano, who is an aspiring filmmaker. I've been doing some behind-the-scenes filming while he's filming some shorts he's been developing. He's been doing some scenes based on Shakespearean sonnets. This photo is one I took while he was filming one based on Sonnet 18 ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"). I especially liked this shot I took of the lead actress, Lindsey, in between filming.
