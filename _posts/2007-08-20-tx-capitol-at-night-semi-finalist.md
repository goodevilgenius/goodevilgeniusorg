Several months ago I took this picture of the Texas Capitol. I took it while waiting for the bus to get home after a late rehearsal for a show in which I was acting at the time.

A few weeks ago, I decided to submit this photo to a contest on [picture.com](http://picture.com). Today, I received a letter from them stating that my photo has been selected as a semi-finalist in the next contest. The Grand Prize is $1000! Well, I'm pretty excited about it, and I'll add more information as I get it.
