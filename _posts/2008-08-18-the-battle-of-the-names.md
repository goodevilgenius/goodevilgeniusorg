Many of you, my friends, are already aware of the difficulty I and my roommates have been having in deciding on a name for our new house, and the [online poll](http://goodevilgenius.org/poll/) we created in order to settle what it should be called.

The voting has been going on for a week now, and will be open until the end of this week. I'd like to remind all of you who haven't yet voted that we'd really like your input, so please go and vote now. If you have already voted, you may change your vote by simply re-voting, if you've changed your mind. There are, in fact, new names that weren't there when the polls originally opened. We've been adding some of the better suggestions that we've been getting.

So, everyone please help us decide on a name. This could, in fact, be more important than the naming of your first-born child.
