Ok, so this has been making the rounds on Facebook, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Here are 25 random facts about me.

1. The idea of living in one place one's entire life (even just childhood life) is so very foreign to me, that when someone tells me that's exactly what they've done, I shudder a little inside, and pity them a bit.
1. On the flip side of that, I don't really understand the concept of _home_, and once in a very rare (and I mean very rare) while I envy those who do.
1. I first recognized this lack of understanding when I was in junior high Latin class and asked my teacher to explain the difference between _domus_ and _casa_. I didn't fully understand his explanation. It wasn't until years later that I realized I wasn't going to understand the concept in Latin if I couldn't understand it in English.
1. Even though I don't understand _home_, I understand _family_ **very** well, and am so blessed to have a great family who's always (and will always) be there for me, even when thousands of miles away.
1. I daydream a lot about having superpowers, or being a super genius.
1. The superpower I usually daydream about having is shape-shifting. I think that, as an actor, being a shape-shifter would be incredibly useful to me, as I would be able to look like any character at all.
1. I love linguistics. I'm fascinated by different languages, because I think that the way a culture communicates says more about that culture than anything else.
1. I'd love to be one of those people who can speak about a dozen or so languages. I hope to become one of those people someday.
1. I'm a little bit accident-prone.
1. When I was about 11, we had this huge pine tree in our back yard. It was about three stories tall, I think. One day I climbed up to the top of it (where it's very thin, and swayed a lot), and waited for my mom to come out. I just wanted to hear "Daniel Ray Jones, get down from there right now." When she finally came out, she did not disappoint me.
1. I probably shouldn't tease my mom like that.
1. She's going to read this and be mad that that was intentional.
1. I used to love school, but somehow, my last few semesters of college sucked that right out of me.
1. Even still, I'd like to get a second degree, because I still love to learn, and recognize the benefit of a structured learning environment. I have no desire to get a master's though.
1. Someday, I will learn [bladesmithing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladesmith).
1. I cry at movies, books, etc. more than I probably should. I generally try to make sure it's not noticeable, unless I'm on a date, and know that the girl is in to sensitive guys.
1. I really like J-Pop.
1. I also like nu metal, screamo, rock, pop, alternative, and a bunch of other musical styles.
1. I really want to stop biting my nails, but have never really put any effort into doing so.
1. If I had to choose one food to eat for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. Yes, I realize that if I did that, I'd probably die in five years at 500 lbs. and unable to move, but at least I would die happy. (except, of course, for the horribly painful heart attack)
1. I'd like to die a very, very old man, in a huge, horrible accident. No boring "peacefully in his sleep" crap for me. When people hear of my death, they should cringe and say, "Oh, that's awful!"
1. I have a lot of scars, the origin of most of which I do know.
1. My original plan was to make a list of 24 fake facts about me, and have the last one say that others weren't true. I decided that sounded lame.
1. This post has 679 words, 46 sentences, a [Gunning fog index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index) of 9.3, a [Flesch-Kincaid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid_Readability_Test) level of 6.2, and a Flesch Reading Ease score of 77.
1. Sometimes I think there might be something wrong with me.
