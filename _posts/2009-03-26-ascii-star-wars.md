I just found a text version of Star Wars that you can watch online. It's AMAZING! You have to telnet [towel.blinkenlights.nl](telnet://towel.blinkenlights.nl), and you can be watching a text version of Star Wars on your computer.

Here's a "screenshot."

For those of you unfamiliar with telnet, try clicking on the link above. It may or may not work, and if not, here's some simple instructions on how to connect:

Windows: Open up the Command Prompt. To do that, click &#8220;Start&#8221; and go to &#8220;Accessories.&#8221; If it's not there, click &#8220;Start&#8221; and the click on &#8220;Run&#8230;&#8221; Type in `cmd` and hit enter. In the Command Prompt type in `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`. Now sit back and enjoy.

Mac: Open up Terminal. Click on the desktop, and hold down Apple-Shift-A. Scroll down to Utilities, and click on it. Scroll down to _Terminal_, and open it. Type in `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`. Sit back and enjoy.

Linux: Figure it out yourself, you're smart.

I haven't finished watching it yet, but what I have watched is fantastic. I hope you all enjoy it, too.
