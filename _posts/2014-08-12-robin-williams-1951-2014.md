A few hours ago, I learned that a hero of mine, Robin Williams, passed away this morning. He was found in his home just before noon, dead of asphyxiation. It appears that he took his own life.

I have a Bachelor of the Arts in Theater. I have been an actor (in one form or
another) since I was about 14. I was inspired to pursue that path in life by the
performances that this wonderful man performed. Whether as a genie, a father
posing as a nanny, or Peter Pan, he inspired me to become something more than I
was.

The world was a happier place with him in it, and it willÂ be a little dimmer for his passing. What breaks my heart the most is that this wonderful man, who brought so much happiness to so many people, died from sadness.

I feel like there are so many things I want to say about him, but the words just won't come, so I'll leave with this thought:

> Seize the day. Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die.
