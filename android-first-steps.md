What follows is my opinion on the most important first steps with a new Android device. I intend to keep this page up-to-date as time goes on with the most relevant information.

Most of this will be a long list of apps that are useful. I&#8217;ll explain what each of them do, and why you might want to use them. A lot of them won&#8217;t be useful to everybody. The important thing to remember is that nobody needs **all** of these apps. So, use good judgement, read the descriptions, and you&#8217;ll know which are best for you.

This guide is intended for phones and tablets. If you have some specialized device (like the [Nexus Player](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_player "Nexus Player"), e.g.), a lot of this will not be applicable to you.

I&#8217;ve broken this down into several pages for various steps. Please follow along on the next pages.

# Other Things to Do

## Keep your apps up-to-date

Don&#8217;t forget to go to the Play Store regularly and update your apps.

## Change your ringtone

It&#8217;s nice to change your ringtone so that you don&#8217;t have the same one as everybody else. That way, when somebody else&#8217;s phone rings, you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s yours.

## Personalize your device

You can, of course, change your background, and ringtones, and other basic things. You should do this to make your phone feel like yours. But there are plenty of other ways to personalize your phone as well. If you don&#8217;t like the home screen (the Launcher) there are a ton of different ones that work in a million different ways. If you want a different lock screen, you can change that too. If you&#8217;re really techy, you might want to install Tasker (previously mentioned), or even [root your device](https://www.google.com/search?q=root+android+device "Google Search: root android device"). Rooting is an advanced topic, and definitely not something the average person should do, but it allows you to expand your phone&#8217;s capabilities, and really use it as the full-fledged computer that it really is.
