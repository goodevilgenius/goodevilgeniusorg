The WordPress app works with both [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/ "Wordpress.com") blogs, and [self-hosted WordPress](https://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress") blogs. It works great. Not only can you blog from your phone/tablet, but itÂ lets you upload photos, view site statistics, and get notified when people comment on your blog (or replies to your comments on other WordPress.com blogs). You can also follow other WordPress.com blogs from the app.

I can&#8217;t really say much about this, as I don&#8217;t use Blogger anymore. So I really have no idea how capable the app is, but it&#8217;s the official Blogger blog, made by Google. I expect it to be pretty good.

I wasn&#8217;t really sure whether to include this under Social or Blogging. Tumblr is somewhere in between the two. In any case, the app works really well. You have your Tumblr dashboard, and you can post all types of tumblr posts via the app.
