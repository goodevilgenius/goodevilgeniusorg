Inbox is a new interface for Gmail that presents your emails as tasks, and gives you powerful tools to keep your emails under control, and help you be productive. It's currently in Beta, and requires an invite to use. If you know someone who uses it, they might be able to send you an invite. Personally, I love it, and it really helps me keep me productive and keeps my [inbox empty](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero "What is Inbox Zero?"). This app could just as easily go under Productivity.

You already have this app. In addition to Gmail, this app now supports reading mail from non-Gmail accounts.

This is a fork from the default Email app, with a whole lot of advanced features. It supports IMAP (including Gmail), POP3, and Exchange.

Google Hangouts is the new communication platform by Google. It replaces Google Talk (aka GChat), and includes more features (although it does away with XMPP support). It can also integrate with your Google Voice account.

This will allow you to make regular phone calls over the Internet (without using your minutes) from Hangouts. If you have Google Voice, it will make calls using your Google Voice number. You can also integrate Google Voice completely with Hangouts, and allow it receive all your Google Voice calls in the Hangouts app. This is especially useful if you're using a tablet, and want to use it to make regular phone calls, and don't want to pay for [Skype To Go minutes](http://www.skype.com/en/features/ "Skype Features").

This is a strange app. It's built by Google. It's an SMS app, which Hangouts can already do, but it doesn't do Hangouts. So, if you don't use Hangouts, but want an advanced SMS app, Messenger might be a good choice. I haven't used it, myself, and don't really have any opinions about it.

[Skype](http://www.skype.com/ "Skype") is a voice and video chat service whose primary benefit is that everybody uses it.

If you use Facebook Messenger, you'll want this app, otherwise, you'll have to use Messenger from your browser. There has been some controversy regarding the permissions required by this app. However, this app uses essentially the same permissions that the main Facebook app uses, so if you're worried about Facebook having too information from your phone, don't install either of these.

I'm not really sure if this is the right category for this app, but it doesn't seem to fit into any of the others, either.

This app is for easy communication within a group, and aimed at family use. You can send quick messages to your family, see where they are on a map, and in an emergency, there's a button to send an alert to your family to tell them you need help.

This is a good Jabber (XMPP) app. It includes security features not found in many other apps. Admittedly, not a lot of people are using Jabber, but if you happen to be one of them, this app is a good choice.

I don't really know anything about WhatsApp, but here it is.
