You are probably going to spend at least some time listening to music on your device. Here are my music picks.

This will probably already be installed. This is Google&#8217;s music service and the default music app on most Android devices. It can play locally stored music files, or stream music from [Google&#8217;s Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen "Google Play Music") service. You can sync music from your computer (including your iTunes library) with this service, and have it automatically available to stream through this app. They also have a service called &#8220;All Music&#8221; which will let you play any song they have available in the Play Music Store. There&#8217;s a monthly subscription fee for All Music but the basic service is free.

Pandora is an excellent music service that can find new music, based on similarities to other music you already like. It&#8217;s based on [The Music Genome Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Genome_Project "Music Genome Project (Wikipedia)"). The free service is fine for most people, but has a few limitations. You can only skip a limited number of songs, and it includes advertising. It&#8217;s about the same as listening to the radio, but with fewer commercials, no annoying DJs, and it learns what music you like the most.

[Songza](http://songza.com/ "Songza") was [recently acquired by Google](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/google-buys-songza/ "Google Buys Songza (Techcrunch)"), and forms the basis for the [&#8220;Moods&#8221; feature](http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/21/google-play-music-songza-stations/ "Google's redesigned Play Music app offers stations that suit your mood (Engadget)") of Google Play All Music. Songza allows you to play music by activity (e.g. Coding, Getting Married), by genre, by mood (e.g. Energetic, Mellow, Sexual), or by decade.

TuneIn is great for playing regular radio stations without a radio. This is really nice if you&#8217;ve moved to a new area and miss the DJs from your former home.

SoundHound isn&#8217;t a a music streaming app. It&#8217;s a music identification app. Hear a song in the grocery store, or on a TV show and what to know what it is? SoundHound is great for that.

There are two competing services. One is [Shazam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android "Shazam (Google Play Store)"), and the other is [Google Sound Search](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ears "Google Sound Search (Google Play Store)"). The one thing that SoundHound has over these other two is that SoundHound can actually identify a song from your own singing or humming, whereas the other two only work with recordings. It doesn&#8217;t work all the time, but it&#8217;s pretty reliable. You might already have Google Sound Search, but unlike the other two, it only works from a widget on your home screen. There is no regular app to open.
