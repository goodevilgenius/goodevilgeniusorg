[FBReader](http://fbreader.org/ "FBReader | Free e-Book Reader") started out life as a desktop application. It works on several platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, Blackberry), and supports a number of formats. On Android, it supports ePub, mobi (Kindle), fb2, RTF, DOC, HTML, TXT, and PDF (through a [plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.geometerplus.fbreader.plugin.pdf "FBReader PDF plugin (Google Play Store)")). It also allows you to add OPDS catalogs, and comes with several pre-installed (check out Gutenberg.org&#8217;s catalog for a huge selection of public domain books).

FBReader doesn&#8217;t support any DRM, however, so most eBooks you&#8217;ve purchased, or borrowed from the library, won&#8217;t be readable in this app (unless you strip the DRM, which is beyond the scope of this article, and perhaps not legal).

Aldiko is a good ebook app, and it supports Adobe DRM, so if you borrow eBooks from the library, they should work in this app. I like it a lot, but it does a lot more than I need, which is why I prefer FBReader.

Perfect Viewer is a great app for comic books. It supports CBR, CBZ, and PDF (through a [plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer.pdfplugin "Perfect Viewer PDF plugin (Google Play Store)")).

You may already have this installed. This is Google&#8217;s own eBook reading app and store.

This is required if you want to read your Kindle books on your Android device (and you don&#8217;t want to strip out DRM).

NOOK is the eBook store and app by Barnes & Noble. They also sell their own Android tablet, which has this built-in.

Kobo used to be own by Borders, before they went out of business. Now it&#8217;s a really good eBook app and store.

Comics by Comixology lets you purchase and read commercial comics on your device.

Wattpad gives you access to millions of free books. Most of the books are by amateurs (hence why they&#8217;re free), and, in my opinion, not well-written stories. I don&#8217;t use it myself anymore because I got sick of the poor quality of the writing.
