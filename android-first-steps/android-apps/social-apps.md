Unless you just emerged from a rock, you&#8217;ve heard of Facebook. Once you&#8217;ve installed the Facebook app, I&#8217;d recommend making one change to the settings.<figure>

Go into your app settings, and turn off &#8220;Video Auto-play.&#8221; At the very least, I&#8217;d recommend changing it to &#8220;Wi-fi only&#8221; so that if you&#8217;re using cellular data, you don&#8217;t get hit with huge data charges because Facebook started playing videos you had no intention of watching. Personally, I turn it off completely, because I find the auto-play annoying.

I&#8217;ve tried many different Twitter apps. The official one used to be pretty terrible, so if you wanted a good Twitter experience, you had to use a third-party app. Nowadays, though, the official app is, in my opinion, the best. It allows for multiple accounts, uploading images, attaching images, and a bunch of other features.

Instagram is a photo-sharing service. With it, you can share square photos using a bunch of different filters.<figure>

If you&#8217;re going to use Instagram, this a good app to have. Since Instagram photos have to be square, you can use this app to add banners to the side of your pics so that you don&#8217;t have to crop out crucial information. Open your images in this app first, add banners (either solid colors, or a blurry version of your picture), and then send to the Instagram app. If you want to be able to crop and add borders (I recommend it), there&#8217;s a setting you need to change. Go into the settings, and check &#8220;Crop photo.&#8221;

Vine is Instagram for video. I haven&#8217;t used it myself, so I can&#8217;t really say much about it.
