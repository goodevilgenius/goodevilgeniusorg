# Before your Purchase

I&#8217;m not going to go into what device is best for you. That&#8217;s way beyond the scope of this guide. There&#8217;s really only one step I really recommend if you&#8217;re planning on getting an Android device.

**Put all your contacts in [Google Contacts](https://www.google.com/contacts/ "Google Contacts").** This step only applies to Google-branded devices. This is most Android devices, but doesn&#8217;t include Amazon&#8217;s FireOS devices, which are using a customized version of Android without any of the Google services or branding.

The benefit of this is that as soon as you log in to your Google account on your new device, you will already have all your contacts available. You won&#8217;t have to sync phone numbers with your old phone, or anything like that.

# After Purchase

Don&#8217;t start using your device until you&#8217;re back home, with your own WiFi. When you get back home, plug in your device, as the battery probably won&#8217;t be fully charged. When you first turn on your device, it will probably ask you to connect to WiFi. It will definitely do this if it&#8217;s WiFi-only tablet. Connect to WiFi, and log in with your Google Account (your Gmail address and password, probably).

It will now ask you if you want to sync settings and installed apps with Google. This is generally a good idea, IMO. It will speed up the setup process on any new devices.

If you&#8217;ve done this on a previous Android device, your device might start installing apps (sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m not yet sure of the rhyme and reason to it) that you had previously installed on your other device. If this is the case, let it install, and come back later.
