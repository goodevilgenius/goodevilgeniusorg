Well, I'm sitting in my Physics class, bored by the teacher because he's reviewing Calculus that I learned in high school, so I decided this would be a good time to post about my new nephew. Shawn Logan Deshazer (he's being called Logan), was born last Wednesday. He's my big sister's first child, and it's my first time becoming an uncle. He's an adorable little boy.
