The other day, I was talking to a friend, who mentioned that another friend had her birthday tomorrow.

"Really?," I asked. "Why wasn't it on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com)?"

"It was."

"Then why didn't I notice it?"

So, I decided to create a small [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org) [script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/7733) to move the Birthdays to the top of the page, and increase the font size.

Here's a screenshot. <img src="http://good.evil.genius.googlepages.com/Screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" align="right" />

If you have [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com), you can install the [greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/), and then install the [user script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/7733) yourself.
