So, I've been pretty bored over the Christmas break (at least, until I got about ten new books for Christmas), so in my boredom, I came up with a great idea for another [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org) user script for Facebook. This one was much more adventurous than my [previous](http://goodevilgenius.blogspot.com/2006/11/facebook-script.html) Facebook script.

I was inspired by the new popup box that Facebook is using for poking people. It even uses some Ajax, which is very cool. I decided I wanted to something like that, but even cooler. I was also partly inspired by another user script called [inYOfaceBook](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4243), which has a popup of large profile images, when you hover your mouse pointer over smaller profile images (like you find in searches, the mini-feed, etc). I decided to combine the two, and add a few more features.

So, after installing this script, a Facebooker can hold down the Alt key, and hover the pointer over a picture, or a name (usually linking to a Facebook profile), and a box will pop-up with that person's picture, and various useful things to do (message, poke, view wall, etc). You can also click on the image, and it will cycle through the various sizes (mini-thumb, like you see on a wall-post, mid-size-thumb, like you see in a search, and full size, like on the profile). Soon, I'll add the person's Networks (or at least the main one) in the box too.

The other feature I'm planning on adding is being able to pop-up just the person's full-size picture, maybe by holding Shift, instead of Alt, and hovering over the link, or picture.

Here's a screenshot. <img src="http://good.evil.genius.googlepages.com/Screenshot-infoBox.png" alt="Screenshot" align="right" />
