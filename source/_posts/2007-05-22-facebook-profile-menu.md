Well, here comes a new [Greasmonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) Script for Facebook. This one was designed because I saw a lack in the new design of Facebook. I really didn't like that they took away the "My &hellip;" links on the left side of the page. On the other hand, I really liked the new drop-down menus. So this simple script takes what used to be in the "My &hellip;" links, and puts them in a drop-down menu next to the Profile link.

Also, while I'm taking about Facebook scripts, I've updated my Info Box script. It broke when Facebook changed the design. I finally got around to fixing it. However, I've got a new idea for another script that I intend to replace the Info Box script. It'll be something like a drop-down menu, perhaps. Anyway, I'm getting tired of the Info Box design.
