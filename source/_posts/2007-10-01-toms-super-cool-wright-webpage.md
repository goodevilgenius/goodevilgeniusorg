My friend Tom recently started a new website: [Tom's Super-Cool Wright Webpage](http://superman.ayerdis.com/). It's hosted on the server of my other friend, Abinadi. Tom thought he must be incredibly clever because he issued a challenge to me to find his web page, if I could. Of course, he didn't tell me the name of the website, where it was hosted, or any other information besides that it had a collection of quotes, and that it linked to (although was not linked from) the website of our friend, Abinadi, called [Rant Fever](http://www.ayerdis.com/rants.php).

He seemed to be proud of the fact that I couldn't find it through Google. He felt some sense of accomplishment for having a site so pitiful that not even GoogleBot bothered to read it.

I actually found it quite easily once I discovered that it was linked from the blog of our other friend, Gavin Gee, which is called [UtiliGee](http://gavingee.blogspot.com). I figured I would throw Tom a bone, and link to it from my blog, so that his site can piggy-back off the popularity of mine. I hope it helps, Tom.

I also wanted to mention that I'm writing this blog entry from the built-in Blog Editor of the [Flock web browser](http://www.flock.com/). It's a derivative of Firefox, so it can use most Firefox extensions (as long as they aren't written to tie too much into the Firefox chrome). It's a browser designed to enhance social networking. The [next version](http://flock.com/privatebeta/) will actually include some very nice Facebook integration, but it currently features integration with [Flickr](http://flickr.com), [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), [Mag.nolia](http://ma.gnolia.com/), and others. I'm not sure if I'm completely ready to leave Firefox yet, but maybe I am.
