My friend Tom recently started a new website: [Tom's Super-Cool Wright Webpage](http://quotes.moonlightcrew.com/). It's hosted on the server of my other friend, Abinadi. Tom thought he must be incredibly clever because he issued a challenge to me to find his web page, if I could. Of course, he didn't tell me the name of the website, where it was hosted, or any other information besides that it had a collection of quotes, and that it linked to (although was not linked from) the website of our friend, Abinadi, called [Rant Fever](http://www.rantfever.com/).

He seemed to be proud of the fact that I couldn't find it through Google. He felt some sense of accomplishment for having a site so pitiful that not even GoogleBot bothered to read it.

I actually found it quite easily once I discovered that it was linked from the blog of our other friend, Gavin Gee, which is called [UtiliGee](https://gavingee.blogspot.com). I figured I would throw Tom a bone, and link to it from my blog, so that his site can piggy-back off the popularity of mine. I hope it helps, Tom.
