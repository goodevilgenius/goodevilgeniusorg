As I mentioned [a couple days ago](http://goodevilgenius.org/blog/index.php?/archives/11-Apple-Insomnia-Film-Contest-2007.html), I helped create a three minute film for Apple's Insomnia Film Contest.

Well, the time to vote has finally arrived! Apple took a little while longer than they expected because they were just overwhelmed with entries this year. Their website is still a little shaky, but you can still [vote for our entry](http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839).

Now, voting is a little confusing. First, you have to get an Apple ID. iTunes and .Mac users can use their account. For the rest of us, we have to [get one](https://myinfo.apple.com/) first. Once you have your Apple ID, you can go to [our video page](http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839). However, the registration to vote is not yet done. Apple wants to make sure you really want to vote for this! So, click on login on the right side of the page under where it says "rate this project." It's going to bring you to a page that asks you to register for the contest. Put information in all the starred (*) fields. For "Captain" put your name. Under "School/University," put whatever you want (University of Texas is a good idea).

Now that this is done, you can go back to [our video page](http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839), and vote (4 stars would be a good vote).

If you have a website, and would like to help promote our video, we have a banner add you can put up to get others to vote. Simply add the following code somewhere on your site/blog:

    <a href="http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia\_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839" title="Vote for Crosswalk"><img style="margin:0px;" src="http://www.zanecochran.com/hosted\_sites/oogafilms/uploaded\_images/crosswalk\_banner3-753832.png" /></a>

It will look like this: [<img style="margin:0px" src="http://www.zanecochran.com/hosted_sites/oogafilms/uploaded_images/crosswalk_banner3-753832.png" />](http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839 "Vote for Crosswalk") 

If you want it centered on a line by itself, try this code:

    <div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia\_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839" title="Vote for Crosswalk"><img style="margin:0px;" src="http://www.zanecochran.com/hosted\_sites/oogafilms/uploaded\_images/crosswalk\_banner3-753832.png" /></a></div>

It looks like this:

<div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://edcommunity.apple.com/insomnia_fall07/item.php?itemID=1839" title="Vote for Crosswalk"><img style="margin:0px" src="http://www.zanecochran.com/hosted_sites/oogafilms/uploaded_images/crosswalk_banner3-753832.png" /></a></div>
