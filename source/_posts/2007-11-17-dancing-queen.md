Thursday afternoon, I was in a class at the [Institute](https://studentview.lds.org/home.aspx/60505). The class was "The Gospel and the Productive Life," taught by Bishop Simmons. The lesson was mainly about [The Word of Wisdom](https://scriptures.lds.org/dc/89), but one of the quotes that was read mentioned the benefits of wholeseome recreation as well. Bishop Simmons told us that the root of the word recreation is re-create, and that if recreation doesn't help us re-create ourself, it's not really recreation. I liked that a lot. Generally when someone explains something to me using etymology, it helps me understand a lot better. This was a concept that had never really occurred to me.

Fast forward to last night. The Institute hosted a "formal" dance: sort of like a mini-prom. I don't really like dressing up, but I wanted to go to the dance. They were also providing dinner, and who's gonna pass up free food? Not me, that's for sure.

So, I went to the dance. I had a beautiful date, who's also great company. The food was pretty good. The music was mostly good. And I danced up a storm. At one point, some fast dance song (maybe it was techno) started playing, and I was dancing pretty fast, and couldn't really tell much of what was going on around me because I was moving too fast. I heard something like, "Go, Dan, go," and I became aware that a circle was forming around me. So I kicked it up a notch, and when I slowed down to move to the edge of the circle to let someone else have a chance, I realized the circle was **WAY** bigger than I thought.

By the time I got home, I was sore from my hips down to my toes. I was also tired. I also felt **really good**. Throughout most of this semester, I've been a bit depressed for various reasons, but after that dance, I felt really good. Not just that I had had a good time, but my outlook seemed a little clearer, and some of my problems not so serious. I thought maybe it was just endorphins. I had expended a lot of energy, and I'm sure I was producing a lot of endorphins, which make you feel good. It was probably just a chemical thing.

This morning, however, I still feel really good. Somehow, going out and partying with good friends just changed my perspective. Which brings me back to the Institute class. This is what Bishop Simmons was teaching us. Thursday afternoon I understood the principle, but Friday night, I truly learned it. We all need some time from the daily grind to re-create ourselves. I guess I hadn't really had that in a while, but last night I got it in a big way. I'm so glad I went to that dance, and so glad I learned that principle.
