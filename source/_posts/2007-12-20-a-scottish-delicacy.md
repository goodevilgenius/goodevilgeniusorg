Last night, I got a craving. I was thinking of my time in Scotland, and some of the stuff I missed from there, and one stood out. Some stuff I can get here in the States, like haggis, or [Irn-Bru](http://www.irn-bru.co.uk/) (it's not easy to find, but not impossible). But there's one uniquely Scottish dish that I have not had in the nearly four years since I've returned home: fried pizza.

If you've never heard of it (and you probably haven't), I recommend reading [this article](http://fxcuisine.com/default.asp?Display=112) from FXCuisine.com.

Well, I decided that I was going to try to make it myself. The aforementioned article helped me figure out how I could do it, as well as [this recipe](http://www.cooks.com/recipe/xi72h16p/fish-and-chips-batter.html) from cooks.com. I thought I'd share with you how I did it, and have included pictures to help out.

I started with a mini-frozen pizza. I don't remember what brand it is, but it doesn't really matter. It doesn't have to be a very good pizza (none of the fried pizzas I had in Scotland were), since the quality of the pizza is not the appeal, but don't get a pizza that's just plain awful. If you don't like it cooked normally, you probably won't like it fried.

I started off putting the pizza in the toaster oven at 375 for about 12 minutes. I then started to mix up the batter. The recipe called for 2/3 cups of flour, half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of vinegar, and 2/3 cups of water. I used a little less vinegar, and just estimated with the salt and baking soda. I mixed them all together until there were no lumps left. This made enough batter for 2 pizzas, with a little left over.

Once I finished with the batter, I took a frying pan and some vegetable oil. I filled the pan so that the oil would cover about half the pizza. I then waited for the pizza to finish cooking, and the oil to get hot. Once that was done, I battered the pizza as completely as possible, and plopped it in the oil. Here's how it looked as it cooked.

When it was all done, I had one great fried pizza.
  
And doesn't that look delicious? And now that I know how to do it, I can go ahead and clog my arteries with this delicacy any time I want. Feel free to try it yourself. I recommend you wash it down with a nice cold [Irn-Bru](http://www.irn-bru-usa.com/).
