I recently had a part in a short film written and directed by my good friend, Arthur Kendrick. The film is titled "The Plumber and the Princess." If you've ever played Mario Brothers, you already know the basic plotline of the film. This is not, however, simply a short version of the game. This is the Italian plumbers as you've never seen them before: gritty 1950s detectives. That's right, this is a _film noir_ version of Mario Brothers.

I play Bowser's goon, Koopa. I hope you all enjoy it. Please rate it on YouTube, and tell all your friends.
