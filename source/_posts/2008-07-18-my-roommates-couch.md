Right now I had planned to be at a dance at church. I was looking forward to it, because it's been a while since I've been to a dance, but I had an experience that kept me from it.

Earlier today, I was at a film shoot. The shoot was in an abandoned building. There was no electricity and therefore no air conditioning, and it got quite hot. So, when I got home, I was quite tired, and decided to take a nap. I was going to nap for maybe an hour, then take a shower, and head off to the dance. So, after taking care of a couple things, I laid down on my roommate's couch. Then was brought forth an event like no other. It was as if the couch did something to my mind, for I did not simply nap, but rather sleep was thrust upon me.

As I awoke, several hours later, I felt as if I were in another world. I looked around the darkened living room, and tried to determine where and when I was. To what distant land had I traveled? In what time had I found myself? Wasn't I supposed to be dancing right now? For a few seconds, I wasn't even sure of my own identity. So powerful was this sleep that my mind was still trying to remain in Dreamland, after the land had already withered away.

After about a minute or so of flitting to and fro between worlds, I was finally able to ground myself back in reality and determine exactly who, where, and when I was. But even now, half an hour later, my mind is still trying to pull me back to that Land of Nod, which I have recently departed. Such is the power of my roommate's couch.
