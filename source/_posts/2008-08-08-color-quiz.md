So, I recently read on [Stephanie Hall's blog](https://redisbetter.blogspot.com/2008/08/color-me-good.html) about an interesting [color quiz](http://www.colorquiz.com/). It's a personality quiz that tells you about yourself based on colors you pick. While I don't think my results are particularly accurate, I thought they were interesting. I particularly found it interesting that I am "able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity." Everything seems to be telling me lately that I need to get married. Anyway, here's my results for your enjoyment.

* * *

### Your Existing Situation

Readily participates in things that provide excitement or stimulation. Wants to feel exhilarated.

### Your Stress Sources

Feels that life has far more to offer and that there are still important things to be achieved&#8211;that life must be experienced to the fullest. As a result, he pursues his objectives with a fierce intensity that will not let go of things. Becomes deeply involved and runs the risk of being unable to view things with sufficient objectivity, or calmly enough; is therefore in danger of becoming agitated and of exhausting his nervous energy. Cannot leave things alone and feels he can only be at peace when he has finally reached his goal.

### Your Restrained Characteristics

Conditions are such that he will not let himself become intimately involved without making mental reservations.

Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity.

Insists that his goals are realistic and sticks obstinately to them, even though circumstances are forcing him to compromise. Very exacting in the standards he applies to his choice of a partner.

### Your Desired Objective

Needs a peaceful environment. Wants release from stress, and freedom from conflicts or disagreement. Takes pains to control the situation and its problems by proceeding cautiously. Has sensitivity of feeling and a fine eye for detail.

### Your Actual Problem

Needs to achieve a stable and peaceful condition, enabling him to free himself of the worry that he may be prevented from achieving all the things he wants.
