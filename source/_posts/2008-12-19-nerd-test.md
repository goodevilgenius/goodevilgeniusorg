I just took the [Nerd Test](http://www.nerdtests.com/), version 2.0, and below are my results. The percentages are actually a percentile. That is, if it says 92%, then I scored higher than 92% of all people.

Here are my results:

> Science/Math: 92%
>
> Technology/Computer: 97%
>
> Sci-Fi/Comics: 98%
>
> Dorkiness/Awkwardness: 88%
>
> History/Literature: 26%
