I finally got word from the JET program. They want me for an interview!

So, in a few days, I should hear from the Japanese consulate in Houston. I don't know if they'll call or email, but they'll schedule a time for me to go down there for my interview.

Now, I have to prepare. I might get a new suit for the occasion. I need to prepare answers to at least some of the basic questions. I know they'll ask me why I want to go to Japan, and why the JET Program. I'm not really sure what else. I've read from a couple other people's blogs about their interviews in past years, and the interviews are all different. They might ask me about my time as a missionary, and about my faith. They might not. It's all a little nerve-wracking, but I won't let it get to me too much. As an actor, I tend to approach an interview as just another performance, only I don't have to act out a character.

Well, I've got preparation to do. Plus, I should probably get back to my job. I have a feeling I'm not going to be very effective at work today.
