If you've been following me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/goodevilgenius), keep up with me [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/danjones), or see me on a day-to-day basis, you've probably already heard about the amazing new woman in my life. Kali Weber came into my life a short time ago, and immediately transformed it. After becoming fast friends, our friendship quickly transformed into romance. It was almost scary how quickly we became everything to each other, but I knew in my heart I had found the woman I should be with for eternity. So, after a two-week courtship, I asked her to make me the happiest man in the world by marrying me.

I know some people are going to be worried. Two weeks is a really short amount of time to really get to know a person. If you had asked me two months ago what I thought of people who got engaged so quickly, I would have told you I thought they were idiots. There is no way they could know after such a short time if they were right for each other. It just isn't possible, and there's no way I'd ever be one of those people. I would also have been wrong. It's true that there is still a lot that we don't know each other, but what I do know about Kali is that she's caring, passionate, a lot of fun, friendly, loyal, and that I am totally and completely in love with her and can't imagine myself with anyone else. Anything else I need to know, I can learn as I fall in love with her over and over again more and more each day for the rest of our lives.

Even more than that, I know that we never should have ended up together had it not been for Divine Providence. I have felt the Hand of God in my life more this past month than ever in my whole life. If the God of Heaven and Earth wants the two of us to be together, then I'm certainly not going to tell Him to cool it off and slow down a little.

I thank Him every day for this wonderful woman he has put in my life. I don't know what good thing I did to deserve this amazing blessing in my life, but a blessing she is. I can't wait to be united with her for all eternity, to spend our lives together, to overcome challenges together, to grow old together, to see children and grandchildren come into our life together. And for all this, I am truly blessed.
