In [Back to the Future II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/ "Back to the Future Part II"), Marty McFly travels to the future in an attempt to help out his future children. That future is soon upon us.

So, I wanted to make sure I knew when Marty McFly arrives. Using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), I created a recipe to send me an SMS on the day that Marty McFly arrives. [IFTTT's Date and Time channel](https://ifttt.com/date_and_time) doesn't let me create one-time events, so I created an annual event (so I'll get an SMS on the pre-anniversary as well).

So, here you have it. Don't let this historic event pass you by.
